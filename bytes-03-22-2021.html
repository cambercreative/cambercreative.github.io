    <h3>This is the lil tech news you need to know for the week commencing March 22, 2021.</h3>
    <p>üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Amazon Will See You Now</p>
    <br>
    <p>Amazon is expanding its on-demand healthcare services, Amazon Care, which has tested with its own employees since September 2019.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The expansion means that U.S. employers will soon be able to sign up for Amazon Care as a benefit to their employees.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Amazon Care offers Telehealth services which it says can connect patients to a physician‚Äìoften within 60 seconds‚Äìany time day or night, to provide a range of primary care and urgent care services. They can even offer overnight delivery of prescription medications and scheduled in-home follow ups with local medical professionals for things like blood draws, vaccine administration, and physical examinations.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our Take: Amazon's gonna Amazon, and the list of things they don't do gets shorter by the day.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We think that competition creates better outcomes for end users, and the healthcare space is one which desperately needs improved outcomes for more people. We hope that a company like Amazon has the resources and pull to do some good in this regard, and even profitably so.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It's encouraging to see many companies‚Äìincluding Camber clients Benefitfocus, AdventHealth, EnterMedicare, and Axle Health‚Äìfocused on generating better healthcare outcomes for a greater number of people.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With regard to Amazon... we can't help but reimagine the movie Idiocracy with Amazon in place of Costco as the company that has become so big that it's practically the one and only institution of any kind left in the world. As in the movie, you won't just shop at Amazon, maybe you'll be born there, you'll get your education there, and you'll get your healthcare there too. üòÜ</p>
