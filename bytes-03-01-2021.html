    <h3>This is the lil tech news you need to know for the week commencing March 1, 2021</h3>
    <p>Stuck the Landing: SpaceX stuck its biggest rocket landing yet when its Starship SN10 prototype touched down in one piece on its test landing pad in Boca Chica, TX this week.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The 400 ft tall Starship prototype launched on 3 Raptor rocket engines to an altitude of 10km, cut engines, and "belly flopped" down to about 1km before relighting its engines to perform a flip-and-land maneuver. If it sounds cool, it looks way cooler.</p>
    <br>
    <p>SN10 did experience a rapid unscheduled disassembly (read: ðŸ’¥) shortly after landing, but SpaceX wasn't counting on recovering the craft in the first place, so it's not totally surprising.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our take: This was the most exciting moment in the Starship storyline so far. We can't wait to see what kinds of space-faring activities become old hat in the Starship era to come.</p>
