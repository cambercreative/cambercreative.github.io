    <h3>This is the lil tech news you need to know for the week commencing March 8, 2021.</h3>
    <p>Passé: Looks like "subscribe" might be going out of fashion, at least for Apple Podcasts. Soon, Apple will change the action button in its Podcasts app from "subscribe" to "follow."</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our take: While it doesn't seem like a big deal, changing what a button says can have a dramatic effect on user behavior–especially when you have the kind of scale Apple Podcasts does.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In a world where everyone seems to want a monthly payment from you, "subscribing" can feel like death by a thousands cuts. "Following" feels like it's asking for less, and asking less is a great way to get people to say yes to what you're asking for. We like the change, and think it will increase podcast follows.</p>
