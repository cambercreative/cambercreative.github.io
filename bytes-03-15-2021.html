    <h3>This is the lil tech news you need to know for the week commencing March 15, 2021.</h3>
    <p>NiFTy Update: Welp. Looks like last week's Byte about NFTs is already outdated. We told you that the highest amount ever paid for an NFT was $6.6 million. The new record is more than 10x higher, clocking in at $69.3 million.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The NFT (pictured above–yes, really) was sold at auction by Christie's (fancy), and puts the artist–who goes by the pseudonym, Beeple–in similar rarified air as the values fetched at auction for works by Picasso, Manet, and Van Gogh. What's perhaps even more interesting is that this auction in and of itself was controversial to fans of crypto and blockchain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Critics say that this was just a marketing stunt for Christie's, arguing that all Christie's effectively did was auction a .jpg file–not an NFT. Since the auction transaction didn't take place immediately on the blockchain ledger (thereby officiating the transfer of ownership of the unique token representing the artwork), Christie's involvement was unnecessary and antithetical to the philosophies of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our take: First, that is an extraordinary price tag. We'll probably see more like it. Hopefully these amounts are not consequential to the buyers. Second, the philosophical point is well-taken that Christie's is an "old school" institution trying to gain a foothold in this new territory. However, we also see the relevance of brokerages for NFT transactions. We wonder if the critics of this transaction are similarly critical of the many websites that are already around to facilitate the listing, discoverability, auction, and purchase of NFTs today.</p>
