    <h3>This is the lil tech news you need to know for the week commencing Feb 15, 2021</h3>
    <p>Signed, Sealed, Delivered to Mars: NASA's Mars 2020 mission achieved a safe landing of its Perseverance Rover–along with its Ingenuity Helicopter–on the surface of the Red Planet.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Perseverance's flight started back in July 2020 aboard an Atlas-V rocket, and concluded with gentle (autonomous) touchdown by Sky Crane to the surface of Mars. NASA's 3D simulation of the approach and landing shows just how complex this approach and landing were.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Perseverance and Ingenuity will perform plenty of science on its own using its variety of robotic capabilities and on-board equipment, but it will also drill and leave behind surface samples to be collected and returned to Earth by subsequent missions.</p>
    <p>Our Take: Successfully landing and remotely operating a robot on a different planet is simply inspiring for humanity. At least a couple of us are personally excited that our names landed on Mars right along with the Perseverance Rover.</p>
