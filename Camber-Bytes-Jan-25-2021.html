    <h2>🚢 Revert! Revert!</h2>
    <p>Microsoft introduced a price increase for its Xbox Live Gold subscription service late last week… and immediately regretted the decision.</p>
    </br>
    <p>After crushing user backlash over the increase–which would have made its service price double that of rival Sony's PlayStation Plus service–Microsoft quickly rolled back the changes (and even sweetened the deal).</p>
    </br>
    <h3>Our Take</h3>
    <p>We think this was a great example of how not to introduce price increases and how to act quickly on user feedback to keep a fan base fiercely loyal.</p>
