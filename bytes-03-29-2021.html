    <h3>This is the lil tech news you need to know for the week commencing March 29, 2021.</h3>
    <p>ðŸ¤‘ Apps Are Making Bank Right Now</p>
    <br>
    <p>$32 billion. That's how much consumers spent on apps in the first quarter of 2021, setting a new quarterly record.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The average iPhone user in particular spent $138 last year on apps, and this average is expected to increase by 30% (to $180) this year.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our Take: We're not surprised that the trend is continuing year over year. We're also not surprised that Apple's iOS continues to be the most fertile ground with regards to revenue generation for app owners.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For many digital products, the mobile apps for iOS and/or Android are the only commerce engine. For many more, the apps are the best experience available for that product.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It feels like eons ago now where being in the "website business" became table stakes for any company. Now, we're not far off from a world in which every company needs to be in the app business tooâ€“be it in the form of internal tooling for operational excellence or customer-facing digital products that create delighted and loyal customers.</p>
