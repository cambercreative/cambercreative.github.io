    <h3>This is the lil tech news you need to know for the week commencing Feb 8, 2021</h3>
    <p>Billion with a B: Tesla confirmed a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin, and its intentions to start accepting it as a form of payment for its products.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is the largest such investment and vote of confidence from a publicly traded company, though there are others with significant Bitcoin holdings on their balance sheets.</p>
    <p>Tesla founder Elon Musk's Twitter account may yet land him in hot water with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (again), over his tweets in support of Bitcoinâ€“which may have driven up the value of Tesla's investment before they had disclosed their investment publicly.</p>
  <p>Our Take: We like the idea of a decentralized currency going truly mainstream, and hopefully gaining some price stability along with its new street cred. You know, so you could actually reliably use it as a currency and not have to worry about the opportunity cost of rapid swings in the exchange rate (as have been common with Bitcoin and other cryptos thus far).</p>
  <p>As an aside, what would you bet that Tesla scooped up all of that Bitcoin at a price that would make their holdings 42,069 whole Bitcoins?</p>
