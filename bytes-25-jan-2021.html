    <h3>ðŸš¢ Revert!Â Revert!</h3>
    <p>Microsoft introduced a price increase for its Xbox Live Gold subscription service late last weekâ€¦ and immediately regretted the decision.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After crushing user backlash over the increaseâ€“which would have made its service price double that of rival Sony's PlayStation Plus serviceâ€“Microsoft quickly rolled back the changes (and even sweetened the deal).</p>
    <br>
    <b>Our Take</b>
    <p>We think this was a great example of how not to introduce price increases and how to act quickly on user feedback to keep a fan base fiercely loyal.</p>
